# Honor Code

Although you are encouraged to discuss ideas with others, your programs are to be completed independently and must be your own, original work, or the work of you and your partners. Whenever you obtain significant outside help (from other students, the TAs, etc.) you should acknowledge this in your program write-up, e.g. “The idea for how to implement ARP decoding came from a discussion with Paola.”

Any violation of the University's policies on Academic and Professional Integrity may result in serious penalties, which might range from failing an assignment, to failing a course, to being expelled from the program.


# Grading

The emphasis is on developing the required functionality and achieving interoperability with other’s solutions. We will pay careful attention to your design document.

*Deliverables*: If you are late for a deliverable, then you lose 2 points per day, up to 3 days late. After that you receive zero for that deliverable.  Over the semester each student has a total of 3 free late days that you can use however you want for any milestone without penalty.

10 | Interoperability   | Your router should interoperate correctly with the routers from all other teams. We will conduct an interoperability test session to verify interoperability.
